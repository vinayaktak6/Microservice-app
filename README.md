# Microservice Project with Flask

## Overview

This project implements a microservice using Flask, integrating various functionalities such as authentication, CRUD operations, configuration management, status & health checks, error handling, Docker containerization, and Kubernetes deployment. It includes a Python client for interacting with the microservice.

## Features

- **Authentication**: JWT-based authentication for secure access.
- **CRUD Operations**: Endpoints for creating, reading, updating, and deleting items.
- **Configuration Management**: APIs to retrieve and update configuration settings.
- **Status & Health Checks**: Endpoints to monitor the status and health of the microservice.
- **Error Handling**: Global error handling for various HTTP status codes.
- **Containerization**: Dockerfile included for containerizing the microservice.
- **Kubernetes Deployment**: Kubernetes manifests provided for deployment.

## Setup

### Prerequisites

Before starting, ensure you have the following installed:

- Python 3.9 or higher
- Docker (for containerization)
- Kubernetes (optional, for deployment)
- PostgreSQL (or any supported database)

### Installation

1. **Clone the repository:**


```bash
   git clone <repository_url>
   cd microservice`
```

2. **Set up a virtual environment:**
   

```bash
   python3 -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate`
```

3. **Install dependencies:**

```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt`
```

### Database Setup

1. **Configure the database URL:**

*-Update the database URL in `config.py` or set it as an environment variable.*

2. **Initialize and migrate the database:**

```bash
   flask db init
   flask db migrate
   flask db upgrade
```

### Run the Microservice

1. **Start the Flask development server:**

```bash
   python app.py
```

*-The microservice will be available at http://localhost:5000.*

2. **Docker Setup:**

-Build and run the Docker container:

```bash
   docker build -t my-microservice .
   docker run -p 5000:5000 my-microservice
```

3. **Kubernetes Deployment**

*-Deploy the microservice to Kubernetes using the provided manifests in the k8s/ directory:*

```bash
   kubectl apply -f k8s/
```

### Testing
#### Run unit tests using pytest:
  
```bash
   pytest
```

### API Documentation
> Swagger UI or OpenAPI documentation can be generated automatically by Flask. Access the Swagger UI at http://localhost:5000/swagger after starting the microservice.

### Client Application
> A simple Python client (client.py) is provided in the root directory to interact with the microservice endpoints. Update the base URL (base_url) in client.py according to your deployment environment.

`  
   python client.py
